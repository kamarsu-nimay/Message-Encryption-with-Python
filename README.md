# Message-Encryption-with-Python

To encrypt and decrypt with Python, you need to create a program in which it will first ask you if you want to encrypt a message or decrypt it. Then the program should receive a message from the user.

If the user chooses to encrypt the message, the userâ€™s message must be transformed into a secret code. But if the user chooses to decrypt the message, your program should be able to convert a secret code into a meaningful text.

This code needs user input to be an even number of characters. The program first checks the number of characters entered by the user, if the character length is odd, the program will add x at the end to make the count even.
